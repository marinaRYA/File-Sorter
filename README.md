# File-Sorter
iFile Sorter is a convenient tool for sorting text and binary files by line length. The user can add up to four files of different formats and select the sorting direction: from short to long or vice versa. The sorted rows are saved in result.txt. The program provides quick and easy organization of data in files.
How to use the program:

Launch the program.
Select option "0" to add files. Specify the names of the files you want to add.
Select option "1" to start sorting. Select the sort order (ascending or descending).
The sorting result will be saved in the result.txt file in the same directory where the program executable file is located.
